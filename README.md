# Nobuntu

**Just a simple gui that does very basic things to make the game more fun to play.**
All you need to do is run then NOBUNTU.lua file and then from there you can load every other module manually from it.

Prefix to toggle the gui ls `right alt`


Here's a loadstring if you want to run it like this.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nobie-git/Nobuntu/main/NOBUNTU.lua'))()
```
